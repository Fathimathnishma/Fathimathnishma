Hi there! 👋  
I’m Fathimath Nishma, a Flutter developer focused on building clean, well-structured mobile applications with smooth and user-friendly UI.

These days I’m working with:
- Flutter & Dart
- Firebase integration
- State management (Provider / BLoC)
- Clean and scalable app structure

Some things I’ve built:
- **FoodCRM** – A food order and monthly expense management app with bill splitting and user-wise summaries.
- **T Educational App** – A UI-focused educational app published on the Play Store.

I enjoy working on real-world problems, improving app structure, and continuously learning better ways to build maintainable Flutter apps.
